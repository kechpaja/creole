A very basic chat client designed for multi-threaded conversations.

NOTE: this project is intended as a proof-of-concept for the type of 
multi-threaded UI implemented here. Some parts, especially the back end, are
quite cludgy, and will need to be replaced before it will be useful in anything
resembling a production environment.
