A very basic chat client designed for multi-threaded conversations.

NOTE: this project is intended as a proof-of-concept for the type of 
multi-threaded UI implemented here. The backend is little more than a test
harness, there is no encryption, etc. Don't try to use this project as an
actual chat client; not without extensive modifications at least.
